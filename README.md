# Prediction Model for Employees Promotion

In large companies, the process of employee promotion can be very tough for the HR team. Identifying the best candidate in a large number of applicants is a huge challenge. The purpose of this notebook is trying to predict the best candidate for promotion based on some features. 

I used a Kaggle dataset in this analysis, you can check the link here: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-ana

In this analysis, it was necessary to solve some issues like:

- Filling Missing Values
- Convert Data to Dummy Variables
- Normalization
- Feature Selection
- Imbaleced Classification

Feel free if you want to contribute to my code ðŸ˜‰
